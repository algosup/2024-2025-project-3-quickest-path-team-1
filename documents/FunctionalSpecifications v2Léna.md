## Overview
### Project summary
Our Software aim to make travel easier with faster pathing using 
the language C++[^C++] and the software VScode. The users can use this to gain time and travel more effectivilly and easily across the United States.
### Project Purpose
This project is an oppurtunity to dive into the very famous laguage C++.
Our main goal is to make a very easy and faster way to travel with an API for everyone and every age.
### Out of scope
|Sellable API|Complex API|
|-|-|
|The project is aimed at teaching us to do a easy and much usefull way to travel with our API. It is not supposed to be really huge and sellable at the final deadline. |To complete this project. We need to create an API that correpond to our requirements, overcomplicating interface can be hard for new users.

### Personas
The primary user of our software include:
    
Adults:
Habits: Have a car to travel and search for a easy and faster travel.

Old person:
Someone who is not acquainted to use a smartphone or a computer, they want to find a not complex way to fast travel.

Goals :
Both of the personnas has the same wish, an easy and precise way to travel. So our goals is to make a simple and an accurate API to travel faster around the United States.


## Functional requirements

 -Specific technology: This API should be developp in C++.

-Specific Data: This API should use the Data sources "USA-road.csv.

-Rest API[^RESTAPI] specification: 

## Non-Functional Requirements
-Specific technology: This API have to only be coded in C++.

-Specific Data: This API will not use other data[^Data] than "USA-road.csv.

-Rest API specification: 

## Feature of the App
-The travel time

-The number of kilometers to acheive to be at the destination

-An easy interface.
## Future improvement
