# I. Overview

As the first week of the project, the team analyzed the call for tender, began writing a large number of documents and developed the first version of the code. The team also set up a naming convention for files and folders, another to ensure a similar layout for all documents, and another for the code convention. Unfortunately, our Program Manager's train was cancelled, and he also fell sick. So we spent a week without him.

# II. Work Planned

During the first week, the plan was to analyze the project's call for tender, plan a new deadline to have a better organization, make the skeleton and advance on each documents, create template for github issues and pull request, make a collaborate white board. Furthermore, we have planned to advance on the code to have a beta. 

# III. Work Done

## A. Documentation

The team started started to develop the project's documentation. The documentation is being developed in Markdown format and is being stored in the `documents` folder.

The Program Manager is responsible for the `FunctionalSpecifications.md`. However, because he was sick all week and because, for this project, the `FunctionalSpecifications.md` and the `UserManual.pdf` have many similarities, the Technical Writer prepared a document to become the `FunctionalSpecifications`, and when the Program Manager will come back, they going to work together to finish it.

The Technical Manager is responsible for the `TechnicalSpecifications.md`. He is also responsible for setting up all the conventions used, the architecture of all documentation, and the organization of files.

The Quality Assurance is responsible for the `TestPlan.md` and the `TestCases.md`. He is also responsible for setting up a whiteboard and Github Issues templates. He has also reviewed three management documents, giving some issues, and fixing them. The whiteboard is used to collaborate with the whole team, stock information, and make teamwork with schema and other graphic and Post-it notes. 

The Project Manager is responsible for the `Settlement.md`, the `ProjectCharter.md`, `WeeklyReport1.md`, and the Time Management.

## B. Development

The development team started to study the project's requirements and started to develop the project. At the end of the week, the Software Engineer has created a beta of the software of the API.

## D. Problems Faced

### 1. Program Manager Missing Train & Sick

#### a. Overview

The Program Manager missed his train at the beginning of the week and, then waiting to take a train, he became sick from 01/07/2025 to 01/10/2025. This part of his work is of high priority at this stage of the project.

#### b. Solution

This problem should not affect the project's schedule. The `FunctionalSpecifications.md`, by the similarity of this document and the `UserManual.pdf`, we have asked the Technical Writer to continue the document. To complete this task, she saw team 4 ask some questions.

### 2. MIT Licence

#### a. Overview

We need to add an MIT License, but adding one is not very intuitive in Github. The Project Manager (PM) and the Quality Assurence (QA) had a big difficulty in achieving this task.

#### b. Solution

After some time of research, when the QA put 'License' in the title, he was invited to another menu and found the tabs when is possible to add it.

### 3. Be Lost on the Project

#### a. Overview

The Technical Leader (TL), the Program Manager (PGM), and the Technical Writer (TW) don't really understand the project. The first doesn't understand the subject and is lost in it. PGM and TW didn't understand the concept of the API.

#### b. Solution

The Software Engineer (SE) explains the project concept to the team. The Project Manager (PM) and the Quality Assurence (QA) try to explain also the project to everyone who needs an explanation.

# IV. Time Management

In the settlement, the team agreed that if we missed any project time, we had to make up at least half the time we missed in overtime.

# V. Next Week's Plan

For the next week, the focus should be on the project's functional specifications as the deadline fixed by the team is 01/20/2025 but the team do not have project time between the 13th and the 15th of January 2025.

The team should also focus on the project's technical as the deadline will soon be reached.
