# I. Overview of the week

As the first week of the project, the team analyzed the call for tender, began writing a large number of documents and developed the first version of the code. The team also set up a naming convention for files and folders, another to ensure a similar layout for all documents, and another for the code convention. Unfortunately, our Program Manager's train was cancelled, he does one remote work to go forward on his doc. However he also fell sick, so we spent a week without him.

# II. Work Planned

During the first week, the plan was to analyze the project's call for tender, plan a deadline to have a better organization, make the skeleton and advance on each documents, create template for github issues and pull request, make a collaborate white board. Furthermore, we have planned to advance on the code to have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). 

# III. Work Done

## A. Documentation

The team started to develop the project's documentation. The documentation is being developed in Markdown format and is being stored in the `documents` folder.

The **Technical Leader** had established all the conventions used, the architecture of all the documentation and the organization of the files. 

The **Quality Assurance** had set up a whiteboard and Github Issues templates. He has also reviewed three management documents, giving some issues, and fixing them. The [whiteboard](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGbahnxBDg/V_nKqqe4qy7hZuCz-ju3PA/edit?utm_content=DAGbahnxBDg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) is used to collaborate with the whole team, stock information, and make teamwork with schema and other graphic and Post-it notes. 

The **Project Manager** had created the Settlement, aproved by whole the team, and the Project Charter.

Finaly, on Github, The **Project Manager** and the **Quality Assurance** wrote the README and added a MIT License.

## B. Development

The development team started to study the project's requirements and started to develop the project. At the end of the week, the Software Engineer has created a MVP of the software of the API.

## D. Problems Faced

### 1. Program Manager Missing Train & Sick

#### a. Overview

The Program Manager missed his train at the beginning of the week, then waiting to take a train, he became sick from 01/07/2025 to 01/10/2025. This part of his work is of high priority at this stage of the project.

#### b. Solution

This problem should not affect the project's schedule. At monday, the Program Manager (PgM) and the Technical Writer (TW) had working in remote because the `FunctionalSpecifications.md`, by the similarity of this document and the `UserManual.pdf`. Therefore, when the PgM fell sick, we have asked the TW to continue the document. To complete this task, she went to see team 4 to ask them some questions.

### 2. MIT Licence

#### a. Overview

We need to add an MIT License, but adding one is not very intuitive in Github. The Project Manager (PM) and the Quality Assurence (QA) had a big difficulty in achieving this task.

#### b. Solution

After some time of research, in the security window, in the policy section. When we want to add a security policy, if we put 'License' in the title, the user was invited to another menu. In this one, we can choose a license to add.

### 3. Be Lost on the Project

#### a. Overview

The Technical Leader (TL), the Program Manager (PgM), the Technical Writer (TW) don't really understand the project. The TL doesn't understand the subject and is lost in it. PgM and TW didn't understand the concept of the API.

#### b. Solution

The Software Engineer (SE) explains the project concept to the team. The Project Manager (PM) and the Quality Assurence (QA) try to explain also the project to everyone who needs an explanation.

### 4. Remote Compiling

#### a. Overview

The Software Engineer (SE) has created the MVP of the code on his windows. However, the achitecture of a windows and a mac are different. Therefore the SE has choosen to use a remote compilling. With that, he compilling the code on the mac from the windows. With this method, we compilling on the mac and all information are displayed on the windows.

#### b. Solution

This problem is not already solved. However, the SE work currently on it

# IV. Feeling

Overall, the team feels very well. Some are tired because the whole work is done and some are enjoying this week because they have made a big step in the project.
