# I. Overview

Management work involves a great deal of responsibility. But we are not omnipotent. So we have to ask the team questions to understand problems and find solutions. We need also to have an advancement of all task to don't be submerged by the time.

# II. Objective

The objectives of the different questions are to better understand each person's point of view on the team's work as well as their own work; to understand if they are progressing as or better than they wanted or not; to understand why they think they need to do overtime; to understand their state of mind; to take each person's opinion to improve the whole team; and finally, to understand what they have planned for the future.
The purpose of task progress is to understand the team's progress, to know if someone is behind schedule or having difficulties, and if there is anything we can do to help.

# III. Questions

* What do you think about this week overall?
* What had you planned to do this week?
* Did you manage to achieve these objectives? If it was different from what you had planned. Why? How many percent of each goal did you achieve?
* If you worked overtime, why did you do it? Because you didn't have enough time for the project? Because you're passionate about it and want to work harder? Anything else?
* What problems have you encounter? If yes, how do you solve them?
* How do you feel at the end of the week? Why?
* What do you think everyone could do to improve their performance, to work more effectively both as a group and as individuals? Try to give a global answer and an individual answer if necessary. All answers will be anonymous, unless you request otherwise.
* Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming week? How do you think you can achieve them?

# VI. Step Software development

## A. Step 1: General Initialization

### 1. Parse command-line arguments

**Purpose**: Extract configuration and runtime options.

**Why**: Defines how the application will run (e.g., file paths, parameters).
### 2. Initialize the logger for global use

**Purpose**: Set up logging for system-wide message tracking.

**Why**: Enables consistent debugging and monitoring across all modules.

## B. Step 2: Data Loading and Setup

### 1. Load graph data

**Purpose**: Read graph input data into memory.

**Why**: Provides the foundational data structure for all operations.

### 2. Parse files to extract graph information

**Purpose**: Interpret the raw data and format it for processing.

**Why**: Ensures the graph data is usable and correctly structured.

### 3. Manage edges within the graph

**Purpose**: Initialize and store relationships between nodes.

**Why**: Prepares the graph for efficient traversal and validation.

### 4. Initialize Union-Find structure for connectivity checks

**Purpose**: Set up a disjoint-set structure for fast connectivity operations.

**Why**: Essential for verifying graph connectivity and avoiding redundant computations.

### 5. Select landmarks for heuristic computation

**Purpose**: Identify key nodes to improve pathfinding efficiency.

**Why**: Landmarks help optimize the ALT heuristic for faster shortest path calculations.

## C. Step 3: Data Validation

### 1. Validate data integrity

**Edge hashing**: Ensures edge data is unique and intact.
Conflict detection: Identifies inconsistencies in the graph.

**Progress logging**: Tracks the validation steps for debugging.

**Why**: Guarantees the reliability and correctness of the graph data.

### 2. Validate connectivity

**Union-Find integration**: Uses the structure to verify connections.

**Connectivity check**: Ensures all nodes are reachable.

**Progress logging**: Records validation progress.

**Why**: Confirms the graph is well-formed and usable for pathfinding.

## D. Step 4: API Initialization

### 1. Initialize the API server

**Socket initialization**: Sets up communication endpoints.

**Continuous listening**: Prepares for incoming client requests.

**Why**: Provides a user interface for interacting with the application.

## E. Step 5: Algorithms and Pathfinding

### 1. Set up pathfinding

**Custom priority queue**: Optimizes node selection in the algorithm.

**ALT heuristic computation**: Speeds up pathfinding using landmarks.

**Bidirectional weighted A search**: Implements an efficient shortest-path algorithm.

**Why**: Enables fast and accurate route calculations.

### 2. Construct the shortest path from results

**Purpose**: Build the final path from the search results.

**Why**: Provides usable output for API responses or further processing.

## F. Step 6: Request Handling

### 1. Handle incoming API requests

**Purpose**: Process user queries for graph operations or pathfinding.

**Why**: Delivers the application’s functionality to end-users.

### 2. Construct and return responses

**Purpose**: Provide results or feedback to API clients.

**Why**: Completes the interaction loop between users and the application.

## G. Step 7: Finalization

### 1. Clean up the logger and release resources

**Purpose**: Shut down logging and free any reserved resources.

**Why**: Ensures a clean exit and prevents resource leaks.
Key Dependencies

Logger initialization is required first for debugging and monitoring.

Data loading must precede validation and algorithms to provide input.

Validation ensures the graph is reliable before enabling the API.

The API server is activated last to ensure all components are ready.
