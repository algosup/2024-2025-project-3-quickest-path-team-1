# I. Overview

Management work involves a great deal of responsibility. But we are not omnipotent. So we have to ask the team questions to understand problems and find solutions. We need also to have an advancement of all task to don't be submerged by the time.

# II. Objective

The objectives of the different questions are to better understand each person's point of view on the team's work as well as their own work; to understand if they are progressing as or better than they wanted or not; to understand why they think they need to do overtime; to understand their state of mind; to take each person's opinion to improve the whole team; and finally, to understand what they have planned for the future.
The purpose of task progress is to understand the team's progress, to know if someone is behind schedule or having difficulties, and if there is anything we can do to help.

# III. Questions

* What do you think about this week overall?
* What had you planned to do this week?
* Did you manage to achieve these objectives? If it was different from what you had planned. Why? How many percent of each goal did you achieve?
* If you worked overtime, why did you do it? Because you didn't have enough time for the project? Because you're passionate about it and want to work harder? Anything else?
* What problems have you encounter? If yes, how do you solve them?
* How do you feel at the end of the week? Why?
* What do you think everyone could do to improve their performance, to work more effectively both as a group and as individuals? Try to give a global answer and an individual answer if necessary. All answers will be anonymous, unless you request otherwise.
* Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming week? How do you think you can achieve them?
