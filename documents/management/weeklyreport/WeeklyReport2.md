# I. Overview of The Week

During this second week, the team worked on the project's documents. The development of the API advanced well, and our Program Manager came back at the beginning of the week. 

# II. Work Planned

This week has been focused on the functional specifications, which must be completed by the start of the third week. The **Technical Leader** planned to advance on the technical specification until 35%. The **Quality Assurance** planned to review the first week's weekly report and the functional, create github's pull request (PR) templates, make the functional's PR to put the functional in the main branch and work on his documents. The developing team will optimize the code. 

# III. Work Done

## A. Documentation

The **Program Manager** and the **Technical Writer** have finished the Functional Specifications and a Pull Request (PR) has done at the end of the week reviewed and approve by the **Project Manager**, the **Quality Assurence** and the **Technical Leader**. 

The **Quality Assurance** had review the first week's weekly report and the functional specifications. He has also make Pull Request (PR) template on github.

## B. Development

The development team have finish to optimize the code.

## C. Completed Tasks

|ID|Task|Due Date|Responsible| Status|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1| Functional Specifications | 01/20/2025 | Loïc NOGUES & Léna DE GERMAIN | Finished |
|12| Issues and Pull Request templates | 01/17/2025 | Lucas MEGNAN | Usable | 100%|

## D. Problems 

### 1. Github & Pull Request

#### a. Overview

As the **Program Manager** (PgM) was a new student and he started with Github. Therefore, when the team wanted to do a pull request (PR) to put the Functional in the main branch, we have missing to put the functional in another branch to just merge the functional.

#### b. Solution

For the PgM, the team explain to him how github work. For the PR, because we can't delete a pull request and it was created earlier than the team create a new branch for the functional, the team has decided to merge the branch documents into the main branch.

### 2. Pre-processing algorithm

#### a. Overview

During this week, the development team will optimize the code to have better performance for the API. They want to implement a new pre-processing algorithm, however it was truly complicated to add it.

#### b. Solution

The development team has find a complex solution. 

## E. Uncompleted Tasks
