# I. Project Overview

This project is an ALGOSUP project, driven by students. This project aims to create an API to find the quickest path of a travel. For this project we use the program language C++.

# II. Project Scope

To create this API, we need an algorithm to find the quickest travel between 2 points.

# III. Project Deliverable

For this project we manage our own deadlines, so the milestones for the project are the following:

- 01/20/2025: Fonctional Specifications.
- 01/27/2025: Technical Specifications.
- 02/07/2025: Test Plan.
- 02/07/2025: User Manual.
- 01/31/2025: Final API.

# IV. Cost

The budget for this project is limited to the material provided. About the time spent on the project, we have at least 94h30 without overtime.

# V. Risks

- **Time**: We only have 6 weeks to complete the project, and might run out of time if we encounter too many problems.
In this case, we will prioritize the tasks according to the order defined in [scope](#ii-project-scope).
- **Time of algorithm**: It is complicated to create this algorithm which works in one second maximum to find the shortest path with 23 947 347 nodes.
