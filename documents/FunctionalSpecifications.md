# I. Overview

## A. Project summary

SmashThePath aims to make travel easier with faster pathing. Users can use it to save time and travel more efficiently and easily across the U.S.
This project is an opportunity to dive into the very famous language C++[^3].
Our main goal is to make a very easy and faster way to travel with an API for everyone and every age.

----

Our Software aim to make travel easier with precise pathing using 
the language C++[^3] and the software VScode[^4]. The users can use this to travel
more effectivilly and easily across the United States.

----

This project is an oppurtunity to dive into the very famous laguage C++.
Our main goal is to make a very easy and precise GPS API for everyone and 
every age.



## B. Out of scope

|Sellable API|Complex API|
|-|-|
|The project is aimed at teaching us to do a easy and much usefull way to travel with our API. It is not supposed to be really huge and sellable at the final deadline. |To complete this project. We need to create an API that correpond to our requirements, overcomplicating interface can be hard for new users.

    -Sellable API
        The project is aimed at teaching us to do a easy and precise API.
        It is not supposed to be really huge and sellable at the final deadline.
    -Complex API
        To complete this project. We need to create an app that correpond to our requirements, overcomplicating interface can be hard for new users.

## C. Personas
This project will not have personas, for the simple reason that the people who will use it have to know how it works and code a software to use effectivily our SmashThePath
## D. Goals
    Both of the personnas has the same wish, an easy and precise way to travel. So our goals is to make a simple and an accurate API to travel around the United States.
