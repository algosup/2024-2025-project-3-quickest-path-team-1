# I. Overview

## A. Project summary

SmashThePath aims to determine the time between two nodes and find the fastest way. Users can use it to save time and travel more effectively across the United States. This project is an opportunity to dive into the renowned C++ language[^3]. Our main goal is to create an easier way to determine the fastest time between two nodes.

## B. Out of scope

|Sellable API|Complex API|
|-|-|
|The project aims to teach us a simple and useful way to manage travel with our API. It is not intended to be very large or commercially viable by the final deadline. |To complete this project, we need to create an API that meets our requirements. An overly complicated interface could be difficult for new users to handle.


## C. Personas
This project will not include personas, for the simple reason that the people who will use it must understand how it works and be able to code software to use SmashThePath effectively.

## D. Use case

# II. Functional requirements
## A. Node and Path Management
The system shall allow defining nodes (landmarks) and their connections with specified travel times.
It shall support reading node and connection data from a file (e.g., USA-roads.csv).

## B. Fastest Path Calculation
The system shall calculate the fastest path and total travel time between two nodes based on the given data.
It shall provide an ordered list of landmarks in the path.

## C. REST API Specification
Expose a GET endpoint that accepts:
Input: Source and destination node IDs.
Output:
Travel time.
Ordered list of landmarks in the path.
Response formats: JSON and XML.


 # III. Non-Functional Requirements

## A. Programming Language
The software must be implemented in C++ to ensure optimal performance and efficient memory handling.

## B. Performance
The system should calculate the fastest path for typical queries within 1 second.

## C. Scalability
The software must efficiently handle large datasets (e.g., 24 million nodes in USA-roads.csv).

## D. API Accessibility
The REST API must run on an HTTP server accessible via localhost and support concurrent requests.

## E. Data Format Compatibility
The system shall ensure compatibility with CSV files and handle potential errors like missing or malformed data.

## F. Reliability
The system must ensure accurate results for pathfinding, even under high load or large datasets.

# IV. Feature of the API

The travel time between the node A and the node B.


# V. Future improvement
