## A. Project Overview

This project is an ALGOSUP project driven by the students. It aims to create an API for finding the quickest path to travel. For this project, we need to program in C++.

## B. Project Scope

To create this API, we need an algorithm to find the quickest travel between 2 points.

## C. Project Deliverable

For this project we manage our own deadlines, so the milestones for the project are the following:

- 01/20/2025: Fonctional Specifications.
- 01/27/2025: Technical Specifications.
- 02/07/2025: Test Plan.
- 02/07/2025: User Manual.
- 02/07/2025: Final API.

## D. Cost

The budget for this project is limited to the material provided. About the time spent on the project, we have at least 94h30 without overtime.

## E. Risks

- **Time**: We only have 6 weeks to complete the project, and might run out of time if we encounter too many problems.
In this case, we will prioritize the tasks according to the order defined in [scope](#b-project-scope).
- **Time of algorithm**: It is complicated to create this algorithm which works in one second maximum.
